nodechess
=========

A realtime 2 player chess game (with support for infinite spectators), written in Client Side and Server Side Javascript using NodeJS and Socket.io.   Players can chat, and see the other player's chess pieces move pixel-for-pixel in real time, as they contemplate moves against their opponent.

Live demo available at:  http://chess.snakebyte.net (Open in 2 browser windows to play yourself if nobody else is around, make sure you can see both windows at once to see how the pieces move)
