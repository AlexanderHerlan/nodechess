nodechess
=========

A realtime 2 player chess game (with support for infinite spectators), written in Client Side and Server Side Javascript using NodeJS and Socket.io.   Players can chat, and see the other player's chess pieces move pixel-for-pixel in real time, as they contemplate moves against their opponent.

Live demo available at:  http://chess.snakebyte.net
